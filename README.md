# ensonic-pd

A couple of free [plugdata](https://plugdata.org/) patches. All patches come with DAW parameters.

I am just learning puredata. If there are betters ways to do things, pull requests are welcome.

## WiCo (Width-Control)

A phase-scope with stereo width control. Available as single and tripple band version.

TODO:
* add normalisation for phasescopes
* add correlation meters (e.g. using `mavg` of the side channel)
* figure out if we can overlay the scopes with additional graphics
* change width params from 0.0 ... 2.0 to 0 % ... 200 %
* add dry/wet control
