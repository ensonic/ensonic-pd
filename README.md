# ensonic-pd

A couple of free [plugdata](https://plugdata.org/) patches. All patches come with DAW parameters.

I am just learning puredata. If there are betters ways to do things, pull requests are welcome.

## WiCo (Width-Control)

A phase-scope with stereo width control. Available as single and tripple band version.

TODO:
* add normalisation for phasescopes
* figure out if we can overlay the scopes with additional graphics
  * we can't overlay a canvas as it does not have a transparent background.
* wico3: Mute/Solo for each band?
